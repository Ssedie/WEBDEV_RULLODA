        <p>
            [Verse 1]
            I’ve been away
            For so many days, I’m missin' it all (Woo, ooh-ooh)
            Where did our time go?
            I’m scrollin’ through pictures saved on my phone
            I wanna go home
        </p>

        <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]
            And I don’t know why, but I’m so, sentimental
        </p>

        <p>
            [Chorus]
            Lately I’ve been thinking of our memories
            All the laughs we shared
            And all the tears we cried (All the tears we cried)
            Hope you know that I’m forever grateful
            All the time you shared
            Staying by my side
            Thank you for the love
        </p>

        <p>
            [Verse 2]
            I gotta say
            There’s still many days when I feel alone (Woo, ooh-ooh)
            So I pray to God
            And then He reminds me, I’m not alone
            He gave me you
        </p>

        <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]
            Woah, it’s just so easy to be sentimental
        </p>

        <p>
            [Chorus]
            Lately I’ve been thinking of our memories
            All the laughs we shared
            And all the tears we cried (All the tears we cried)
            Hope you know that I’m forever grateful
            All the time you shared
            Staying by my side
            Thank you for the love
        </p>

        <p>
            [Bridge]
            And when I find myself in pieces on the ground (Ooh-woah)
            You pick me up and turn me back around (Ooh-woah)
            And any day could be our last (Ooh-woah)
            So I’ll be holding onto all the love we found
        </p>

        <p>
            [Chorus]
            Lately I’ve been thinkin' of our memories
            All the laughs we shared
            And all the tears we cried (All the tears we cried)
            Hope you know that I’m forever grateful
            All the time you shared
            Staying by my side
            Thank you for the love
        </p>

        <p>
            [Outro]
            Ohh
            Where would I be without ya?
            Ooh-oh
            Thank you for the love
        </p>
